## About

This repo contains a custom component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) that provides the ultimate thermostat control for your home.
It brings together all of your temp sensors and temperature control appliances for your house and can seamlessly control between them. It has many
optional features that allow for optimal thermal control.

It also allows you to select between several different modes:
 1. max comfort: minimizes temperature fluctuations but may use more energy
 2. eco mode: minimizes carbon footprint
 3. budget mode: minimizes energy expenditure (if you only have one type of heating or cooling this is the same as eco mode)

>[!WARNING]
>All of the above is aspirational nothing has been implemented yet.
